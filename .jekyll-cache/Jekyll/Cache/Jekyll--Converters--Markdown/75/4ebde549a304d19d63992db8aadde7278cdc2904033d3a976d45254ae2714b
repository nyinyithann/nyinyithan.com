I"X<p>I heard of Rust back in 2015 at a meetup. I have since spent time with Rust on and off. In 2018, I had more time to explore Rust. Thinking of using blogging as a learning tool while going further down the rabbit hole of Rust, I setup this blog. In this post, I would like to briefly walk through some important features of the language.</p>
