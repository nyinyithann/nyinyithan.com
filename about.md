Hi,

This is Nyi Nyi. I am a father, husband and software developer.
Nowadays I mainly work with C#, F#, ReScript, JS / TS. Before that I worked with Visual Basic 5/6 and Java for a few years.

I am interested in programming languages and also love to develop software products.
Currently I spend my time learning OCaml, Rust and Kotlin.

If you have an interesting opportunity for me, you can direct message me on Twitter [@JazzTuyat](https://twitter.com/jazztuyat) or email me at [nyinyithann@gmail.com](mailto:nyinyithann@gmail.com).
